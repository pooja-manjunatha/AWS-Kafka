# AWS-Kafka
Real-Time Stock Market Data Engineering Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for real-time stock market data using a combination of technologies including Apache Kafka, AWS (Amazon Web Services), Glue, Athena, Python, and SQL. The pipeline captures real-time stock market data, processes it, stores it, and allows querying the data for analytical purposes.

Technologies Used
Apache Kafka: For real-time data streaming.
Amazon Web Services (AWS):
AWS Glue: For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.
AWS S3: For data storage.
AWS Athena: For querying the data stored in S3.
Python: For scripting and processing data.
SQL: For querying data.
Prerequisites
AWS Account
Apache Kafka setup (local or cloud)
Python 3.x installed
AWS CLI configured
Necessary Python libraries: boto3, kafka-python, pandas
